- Forced to scrap larger portion of combat entirely due to previous errors 
- Collapsed enemy models remain as “set dressing”, as it were

- Hours Spent: 8
- Work Description: Began producing Demo Videos 1, 2, and 3 after finally checking the Fall 2020 timeline document, which I had irresponsibly ignored in favor of the D2L course calendar, and discovering that I had long missed the due dates for these demos under the false and ignorant assumption that they did not have strict due dates, formed based on their display in the D2L calendar
- As I have long missed the deadlines for posting Demo Videos 1 and 2 to their respective discussion boards, I will simply e-mail these videos instead
- I am aware that this method of submission will have no impact upon my grades for those two discussion boards, and merely choose to submit these videos of my own accord and personal feelings of obligation
